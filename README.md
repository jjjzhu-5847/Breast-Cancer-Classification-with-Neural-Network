# Breast Cancer Classification with Neural Network
ðŸ“– Project Summary

Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers worldwide, and early detection plays a vital role in improving survival rates.
This project applies machine learning and neural networks to the Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset to build a predictive model that classifies tumors as benign or malignant.

The notebook demonstrates:

Data preprocessing and feature scaling

Designing a feed-forward neural network using TensorFlow/Keras

Training and evaluating the model with accuracy and loss metrics

Visualizing performance with plots for better understanding

The model achieves high accuracy, showing that neural networks can be an effective tool in medical data classification tasks.

ðŸ“Š Model Training Report

The neural network was trained for 10 epochs.

Training Accuracy steadily increased from 36% (epoch 1) to 96% (epoch 10).

Validation Accuracy improved from 45% (epoch 1) to 95% (epoch 10), showing good generalization.

Training Loss decreased from 1.0979 to 0.1335.

Validation Loss decreased from 0.7609 to 0.1274, without signs of overfitting.

Final Epoch Results:

Training Accuracy: 0.9612

Training Loss: 0.1335

Validation Accuracy: 0.9565

Validation Loss: 0.1274

The model demonstrates strong performance and generalization on unseen data.

# ðŸ§  Breast Cancer Classification with Neural Networks

## ðŸ“– Project Overview

Breast cancer is one of the most prevalent cancers globally, and early detection is crucial for improving patient outcomes. This project leverages machine learningâ€”specifically a feed-forward neural network built with TensorFlow/Kerasâ€”to classify tumors as **benign** or **malignant** using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset.

The model demonstrates strong performance and generalization, making it a promising tool for medical data classification tasks.

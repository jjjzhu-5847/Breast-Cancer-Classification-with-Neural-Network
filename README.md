# Breast Cancer Classification with Neural Network

This project implements a **Neural Network classifier** for predicting whether a tumor is **malignant** or **benign** using the **Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset**.

## 📌 Features
- Loads and preprocesses the Breast Cancer dataset  
- Builds a **Neural Network classifier** using TensorFlow/Keras  
- Trains and evaluates the model on the dataset  
- Provides accuracy and loss metrics with visualizations  
- Helps understand the effectiveness of neural networks for binary classification

## ⚙️ Requirements
Make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- NumPy  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib / Seaborn  
- scikit-learn  
- TensorFlow / Keras  

Install dependencies with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Breast-Cancer-Classification.git
   cd Breast-Cancer-Classification
   ```
2. Install the dependencies.  
3. Open the notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Breast_Cancer_Classification_with_Neural_Network.ipynb
   ```
4. Run all cells to train and evaluate the model.  

## 📊 Results
- The model achieves high accuracy in distinguishing between **malignant** and **benign** tumors.  
- Performance metrics and learning curves are visualized in the notebook.  

## 🔮 Future Improvements
- Experiment with deeper or wider neural networks  
- Hyperparameter tuning (learning rate, batch size, optimizers)  
- Cross-validation for more robust evaluation  
- Compare with other ML models (SVM, Random Forest, etc.)
